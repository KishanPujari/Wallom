## 🧠 Overview

**Wallom** is a lightweight, terminal-based strategy game where you control a player in a grid world filled with:
- AI-driven enemy
- mines and traps
- walls
- collectibles
- persistent game state (JSON save system)

The game is built as a **modular PowerShell engine**, simulating a mini game framework inside the terminal.
